INFORMATION:
    - creates tree
    - adds items to the tree
    - prints the tree
    - pretty prints to see if the tree is balanced
    - deletes some nodes from the tree
    - destroys the tree

TESTS:
    1) after added elements to tree I hand drew it to see if it was balanced and it was
    2) after deleting nodes I checked to see if the new printed version was what it was suppose to look like
    3) I checked to see if the rotations occured correctly
    4) I checked to see if the min-node returned what it was suppose to
    5) I checked the height to see if the height returned was correct
